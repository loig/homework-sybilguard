\section*{Introduction}

%% Sybil Attack
%%   - State its definition
%%   - Practical interest of canceling the Sybil Attacks

%% Impossibility Result
%%   - State the result: Douceur [IPTPS'02]
%%   - Consequence: to avoid Sybil Attacks, we must use a Central authority
%%   - Consequence: OR we should solve a weaker problem

%% SybilGuard trade-off
%%   - Solve a weaker problem: (very briefly) describe the problem solved
%%   - Still, useful: attenuate its supposed weaknesses
%%   - Demonstrate some uses: give example of what can be done with the guarantees it provides

%% Our plan
%%   - Present our plan
%%   - Particularity: the experimental results are mentioned along the text, 
%%                    to highlight the practical value of this system

\section{Design Rationale}

%% Social Network
%%   - based on human, strong trust relationship
%%   - particular quotient cut of ``normal'' social networks
%%   - definition of ``attack edges''
%%   - ``fast mixing'' property of social networks 
%%      - definition 
%%      - implication for the theoretical study

%% Random route
%%   - Principle (to compare with random walk)
%%   - ``Good'' length of a random walk
%%       - What is ``Good''
%%       - Theoretical results, at least in the case of a Social Network
%%   - Loops
%%       - Where do they appear
%%       - What is there impact (reduce efficiency, not soundness)
%%       - Experimental result: Section 6.1 paragraph 1

%% Guarantees provided by SybilGuard
%%   - Bound the number of Sybil groups
%%   - Bound the size of Sybil groups  
%%       - Experimental result: Section 6.2 paragraph 1
%%   - Accept honest nodes with hight probability
%%       - Experimental result: Section 6.1 paragraph 2, Section 6.2 paragraph 2

\section{Distributed Algorithm}

%% Protocol Overview

%% Data-Structures
%%   - Registry table
%%   - Witness table
%%   - Scalability considerations
%%      - Number of entries
%%      - Memory footprint

%% Determining the length of random routes
%%   - Principle
%%   - Experimental result: Section 6.1 paragraph 3, Section 6.2 paragraph 3


\section{Dealing with Dynamic Networks}

%% Routing tables maintenance
%%    - Algorithms for adding/deleting an edge
%%    - Generalization to adding/deleting a node
%%    - Can take days to complete, there is no hurry: work at the social level

%% Dealing with Offline nodes
%%    - State the cases where a communication is required
%%    - For each case, give the insight that a majority voting on a redundant random routing solve the problem
%%    - Describe the redundancy routing principle: Section 4.4
%%      - Mention that it also avoids attacks exploiting dynamism
%%      - Mention that it also helps nodes close to a Sybil zone

\section{Conclusion}

%% Scalable solution to fight Sybil attacks

%% Based on theoretical results

%% Lack of real-life deployment
