\section*{Introduction}

%% Sybil Attack
%%   - State its definition
%%   - Practical interest of canceling the Sybil Attacks

In peer-to-peer systems (and more generally in large distributed systems) a \emph{sybil attack} is a situation where a malicious user obtains multiple identities associated with multiples different nodes of the system.
Most byzantine failure tolerant protocols assume that no more than $1/3$ of the nodes are byzantine.
So, if a sybil attackant can control a large part of the system (more than $1/3$ of the nodes), he is able to break all defenses against byzantine failures.
Hence, providing efficient defenses against sybil attacks will improve possibilities of collaborative tasks based on voting schemes on peer-to-peer systems.

%% Impossibility Result
%%   - State the result: Douceur [IPTPS'02]
%%   - Consequence: to avoid Sybil Attacks, we must use a Central authority
%%   - Consequence: OR we should solve a weaker problem

In~\cite{douceur} an important result is prooved: without a central (and trusted) authority responsible for checking that a one-to-one correspondance between users and identities exists, one can always have multiple identities.
That is why \emph{SybilGuard}, which is a fully decentralized solution, proposes to solve a weaker problem.

%% SybilGuard trade-off
%%   - Solve a weaker problem: (very briefly) describe the problem solved
%%   - Still, useful: attenuate its supposed weaknesses
%%   - Demonstrate some uses: give example of what can be done with the guarantees it provides

Instead of totally avoid sybil identities SybilGuard suggests to bound the number of sybil groups (i.e. groups, defined by an equivalence relation, which contains sybil identities) and the size of these groups.
In fact even if SybilGuard does not fully prevent against sybil attacks it is sufficiently strong to be useful.
For example, in order to maintain replicas of a file, ensure that at most $g$ sybil groups exist allows to provide only $g+1$ replicas (to ensure that at most one is not on a sybil node).
Moreover having a bounded number of sybil nodes, smaller than the total number of nodes, ensures that, by randomly assign the replicas, the probability of having a majority of replicas on honest nodes will grow exponentially with the number of replicas.

\section{Design Rationale}

%% Social Network
%%   - based on human, strong trust relationship
%%   - particular quotient cut of ``normal'' social networks
%%   - definition of ``attack edges''
%%   - ``fast mixing'' property of social networks 
%%      - definition 
%%      - implication for the theoretical study

SybilGuard is based on a social network, that is a graph where the topology is constructed from human-established trust relations: there is an edge between two entities if and only if they know eachother (e.g. they have friendship relations in real life).
The principe of SybilGuard is to let a node $V$ accept a node $S$ if and only if a random walk from $V$ in the social network intersects with a random walk from $S$.

Generally social networks have  big \emph{quotient cut}: a large number of nodes can not be disconnected from the rest of the graph by removing a small number of edges.
In presence of many sybil nodes the quotient cut of such a network becomes small: a small set of edges (called \emph{attack edges}) disconnect a large part of the graph (the sybil nodes) from the rest of it when removed.

Moreover, social networks ensure a property called \emph{fast mixing}: after a small number of hops on a random walk ($O(\log n)$ hops) the walk becomes roughly independent from its starting point.
In particular it means that in a social network two random walks starting from two different nodes have high probability to instersect eachother after a small number of hops.

%% Random route
%%   - Principle (to compare with random walk)
%%   - ``Good'' length of a random walk
%%       - What is ``Good''
%%       - Theoretical results, at least in the case of a Social Network
%%   - Loops
%%       - Where do they appear
%%       - What is there impact (reduce efficiency, not soundness)
%%       - Experimental result: Section 6.1 paragraph 1

\paragraph{}
In order to be able to exploit the two properties defined above, SybilGuard uses the concept of \emph{random routes}.
Random routes are walk in the graph based on random routing tables: at the begining each node computes his routing table (which is a random permutation of his edges) and then these routing tables are used to computes the random routes.
In fact if a node initiates a walk $w$ by a given edge with a fixed length then all walk initiaded by the same node with the same edge will be exactly $w$.



%% Guarantees provided by SybilGuard
%%   - Bound the number of Sybil groups
%%   - Bound the size of Sybil groups  
%%       - Experimental result: Section 6.2 paragraph 1
%%   - Accept honest nodes with hight probability
%%       - Experimental result: Section 6.1 paragraph 2, Section 6.2 paragraph 2

\paragraph{}
Using the concept of random routes and the properties of social networks, SybilGuard provides some properties of practical interest.

SybilGuard allows the number of sybil groups to be bounded by the number of attack edges.
This is ensured by the properties of random routes: if two routes share an edge then they share all there edges after it.
Because there is a bounded number $g$ of attack edges, the random routes starting at sybil nodes can only follow $g$ different paths in the honest part of the social network.
Thus, SybilGuard will let node $V$ put in the same group all the nodes which random route intersect the random route of $V$ at the same node and coming from the same edge.
Finally, for $V$, there will be at most $g$ groups of accepted nodes which can contain sybil nodes.
